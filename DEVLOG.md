I want to use this camera... it has no software on it... so I'll throw something together based on Pi Zero HQ Cam's code... which is not good code, I keep having to restart it at the field

I just want to use this camera outside

I will add a start up camera detection thing which will then add the ability to change the aperture by pushing up/down on live preview with the overlay

I'll also add the overlay in MP based on camera

Oh dang... right the LCD drivers are different

Those will need wrappers

I want to use this camera... it has no software on it... so I'll throw something together based on Pi Zero HQ Cam's code... which is not good code, I keep having to restart it at the field

I just want to use this camera outside

I will add a start up camera detection thing which will then add the ability to change the aperture by pushing up/down on live preview with the overlay

I'll also add the overlay in MP based on camera

Also thought about how the LCD dimensions out to be from outside in if the icons are near the edges of the screen

Still trying to get the display running

I'm waiting for a UPS package that may or may not get delivered to me sucks, apt complex life

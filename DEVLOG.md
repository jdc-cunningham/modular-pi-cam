ugh... I started around 10 AM and I have NOTHING!!! to show for lmao, tragic

Now doing the AP route for the mobile control of the Pi Camera

I had to reflash the ml-hat-cam (pi 4) board with bookworm so it has network manager as the default internet access vs. dhcpd

Was dumb like "so if I switch this to networkmanager I lose connection right?" yes...

installing picamera2 right now... weird this "external" error

I'm going to have to redo the modular pi cam's sd card as well ugh... also using bullseye

Okay I was able to get a hotspot going and run the node app

It looks like it will be a flask app (python server) so everything's "homogenous"

This looks good since I want a pretty url to go to

Damn... wasted a day sucks

I'll probably do some variant/combination of the mjpeg_server.py output with controls on the sides/overlaid if too small

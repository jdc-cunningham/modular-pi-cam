I took today off but damn I slept way too long. The clock did move an hour forward.

I woke up at 2PM, not sure what time I slept... normally I'm up by 5:55 AM to get ready for the factory work

I'm still waiting for some parts, the 10MP lens in particular and then some more filament

I'm going to design the sliding mount thing today and start designing the camera around that big display

I want to put an IMU in the camera... was also thinking a speaker but the Pi Zero doesn't have an aux cable

Which I've done a GPIO hack before from a tutorial to get sound out, but it's not really worth it... other than shutter sound

The IMU is similar... like a horizon line is cool but not really much more than that

Other versions I guess, new body or something

I want to get this camera done by end of 3/13/2024 also

What I'm concerned about right now is the type-a cables are kind of long so the height of the sliding thing and length will have to be sizeable

Ooh... immediate fail... the camera will be rotated if they're mounted sideways

I'm burning a new bookworm rpi image to the 128GB gold sadisk micro sd card... ugh... I initially was going to buy 64GB but the 128GB was $1 more lol crazy

I'm fighting the feeling of "tihs project is pointless, you are poor" right now

Escape from reality

I want to actually use this camera and it's spring time now so the redbuds here in Kansas will come out, those are super pretty

I really hope I'm not sick too, I was crammed in a room of like 50 people the other day to do some training and people were coughing/sneezing

2:50 PM

This will work

It's not that high and the cable isn't crushed

The 15-pin bridge does not have any mounting holes so I'll have to come up with a snap in clip for it

It could also just be glued down... hot glue yeah... I don't want to spend much time being fancy

A channel that it sits in then glued down would work, hot glue so it can be undone

2:54 PM

Hehe... a new RPi enters the local network, 234

Damn this is long

Quick break

Back on

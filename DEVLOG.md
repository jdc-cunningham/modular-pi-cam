I just got the parts, I'm really gushing over the touch screen demo that comes with the 1.28" ESP waveshare display

4:37 PM

As of right now the design is not solidified yet, it will help to make the physical part models/arrange them but I have a vague idea from this old drawing.

After trying the touch screen round display I'm really impressed wow... like I want to make a watch project or something... I'm not a watch person though

4:53 PM

So this is the design I'm going with roughly

While modeling the LCD screen, I decided I'm not going to screw it down rather use glue, not on the weak parts, the wires and part of the PCB.

It's not touch so this won't get much pressure applied to it anyway.

Otherwise it will use compression fit to fit into the body

5:41 PM

Today I'll definitely get the LCD turned on, I may even keep the pins as is/male header vs. soldering custom board.

I could see it working... the pins use the 3.3V pin of the pi/with resistor to feed the control board, then into the GPIO pins... reduces parts

Oh man... I can't accept that the photos will be bad... if you were to actually use this camera

Maybe I will upgrade it to the 12 MP v3 camera... same dimensions roughly as v2 looks like

What's funny is I probably won't use this camera anyway after it's built

6:13 PM

Ugh... yeah... I gotta get the wide angle one damn... that will delay parts but I will just make the part where the camera sticks through big so it can fit/I can work with the 8MP in the mean time

What's annoying is I can't buy it from Amazon, I keep finding Arducams

I'm also trying to decide wide angle or short angle... but it won't be useful as a video camera since no audio/pi zero 1

Ugh... will I actually take this to park... idk

It's worth it though

Lol... I can drive to my microcenter and get one

They don't have the wide though just normal... I mostly shoot landscape so it has to be wide

Let me see if I can afford it too ugh... I wish I didn't buy the v2... I can use it for something else

6:24 PM

Other thing that sucks, touch screen can be useful for drag/drop/point zooming vs. physical button

Ahh... I'm taking a risk with this Arducam but I suppose I have used one before the ML Hat Cam's camera was arducam

Hmm... I actually may not be able to buy this right now lmao... I can just design different face plates that hold the camera sizes...

Which means... I can actualy wait and buy a name-brand Rpi module 3 camera

6:54 PM

We're back on... I'll just order that in the future, upgrade face plate sort of thing, I could make the front have an inner interchangeable piece but I want a whole usable thing by end of these 4 days off today is 1st day

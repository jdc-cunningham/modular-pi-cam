3:00 PM

Doing some designs

Example menu scene:

- asking if battery is charged

Has:

- question
- left text
- right text (active box)

Inputs are left/right and then center click

How do you make a standard with that?

Some ideas on main/home menu

- recording icon (red solid circle) top left
- battery indicator top right (in hours/mins)
- bottom icons
- status in middle eg. camera ready?

I don't have small text only 24 and 18 I think

I can pull the smaller text from the ml-hat-cam project

3:36 PM

bare minimum I can do today besides printing is come up with the menu design

Unfortunately I'll have to wait till Christmas before I can write more code ha... that'll be my present I guess lol

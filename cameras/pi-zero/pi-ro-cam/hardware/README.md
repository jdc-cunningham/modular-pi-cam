### Wiring

Sorry this is a pretty lazy one but basic wiring no step down or other sensors

Refer to annotated image above for what each part is

### Disclaimer

This uses a cheap charger/bms that gets very hot. Also the charger is more intended for an 18650 cell (low voltage cutoff) so the software tries to prevent going that low for a pouch-style 3.7V lipo cell that ideally does not go below 3.7V or 3.0V max.
